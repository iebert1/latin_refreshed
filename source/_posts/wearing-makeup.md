### What was the Art of Beauty 2000 years ago?

*Is BEAUTY "in the eye of the beholder"?
 Yes and No...*

In this day and age women (and men by default) have embarked on "a wild-goose chase" - *to obtain the "unobtainable* - ****Media Generated Beauty Standards****. And even though the ****Photoshop Culture**** has penetrated numerous locations around the world, the *ideal beauty* still remains an elusive concept because each culture sees *beauty* subjectively. This notion has been explored by *Esther Honig* in her ****[Before & After](http://www.people.com/article/beaty-standards-photoshop-esther-honig)**** project when she sent her image to about 40 Photoshop artists around the globe, with a simple instruction: “make me beautiful“).

But despite common knowledge that standards of beauty vary around the world and the media-produced *anti-aging beauty* is more often than not "edited" by sophisticated software, our subconsciously driven tendency to strive for the *magazine perfection* results in ****hundreds of dollars spent at ULTA and Sephora**** where *fishy smelling face plasmas* and *algae-based anti-aging moisturizers* cost a pretty penny.

Primers and concealers, bronzers and highlighters, foundations and etc etc etc. Their price tags vary from Walgreens to Cos Bar in Manhattan.

The bottom line - *we are obsessed with looks!* But what happened in the long-gone past and how did the ancient women perceive themselves through the lens of the *society-imposed standards*?

Approximately 2000 years ago ****back in Ancient Rome**** the state of affairs was similar in its essence. Prices for ancient cosmetics ranged from low to high. Wealthy Roman women emphasized their ****social status**** with ****expensive beauty items****. Cheap cosmetics often had unpleasant odors and were frequented by ancient prostitutes who often unskillfully overused them on their appearances.

Makeup is and equally was an artistic form, often intricate and meticulous. Therefore, the *quality* process of applying ancient makeup was an elaborate endeavor and required a trained beauty specialist (a slave referred to as ****cosmeta****).

Ancient Roman women enjoyed a wide range of beauty products but their quality lacked durability - ****cremes quickly "melted away"**** and had to be reapplied as often as every couple of hours.   

In Book III of ****“Ars Amatoria”**** (****“The Art of Love”**** in English) ****Publius Ovidius Naso****, a Roman poet commonly known as Ovid, sheds light on various beauty techniques implemented by Roman women 2000 years ago.

{% blockquote Ovid, Ars Amatoria %}
Don't ****those ointments smell****?
Even if they are sent from Athens,
they are ****oils extracted from
the unwashed fleece of a sheep****.
{% endblockquote %}

The ****facial grease**** extracted from the ****unwashed fleece****?! What in the world?!
Wait, but it actually was and still is an effective *beauty product*... ****Lanolin**** is the actual term referred to the ****wool grease**** (or ****wool fat****) and used extensively in products designed for the protection, treatment and beautification of human skin. There is a whole ****[article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanolin)**** devoted to the significance of Lanolin (from the Latin words ****lana**** for 'wool' and ****oleum**** for 'oil') both in the ancient and modern high-end beauty industries.

As Ovid continues, we learn more about common "beauty recipes" favored by Ancient Roman women -

{% blockquote Ovid,Ars Amatoria %}
Don't apply preparations of
****deer marrow**** openly...
{% endblockquote %}

OMG ... Let's hope they didn't! But as wacky as it sounds, ****deer's marrow**** was a common ingredient in ancient cosmetics and ointments. Another famous writer from the times of Antiquity - **** the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder**** - in his book ****Natural History**** recommends a preparation of veal suet (suet is often referred to the hard fat found around the loins and kidneys), deer's marrow, and whitehorn leaves for facial blemishes - the usage of poisonous and disgusting ingredients in facial remedies.

Ovid felt so compelled to teach ancient women how to take care of their appearances that he even wrote a poem of 100 verses dedicated entirely to facial treatments - ****Medicamina Faciei Femineae**** (Cosmetics for the Female Face, also known as *The Art of Beauty*). One of the suggested concoctions for a facial mask was a mixture of barley, vetch, egg, hartshorn, narcissus bulb, gum, Tuscan spelt, and honey. Ovid promises that any woman who uses this recipe on her face ****will shine smoother than her own mirror.**** The majority of the ingredients Ovid prescribes are in fact effective skin treatments. Oatmeal, wheat germ and egg white are still used in the manufacture of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals today.

Yep, Ovid did his research... Did he experiment on himself? ... Who knows ... But it's worth suggesting that maybe the poet's *obsession* with *youth and beauty* (while the first emperor Augustus was trying to revive *good ol' conservative values*) was the real reason for his eventual exile from Rome.

the Roman natural philosopher Pliny the Elder, whose compendious treatment of facial remedies often includes exotic, poisonous, or disgusting ingredients.[

Anyway Ovid's wisdom keeps on giving - he cautions women to perform their ****beauty preparations**** in a ****private setting****.

{% blockquote Ovid,Ars Amatoria%}
...and I don't approve of openly cleaning your teeth:
it makes for beauty, but it's not beautiful to watch:
many things that please when
done, are ugly in the doing...
{% endblockquote %}

Bold attitude but is arguably still relevant in our modern day and age!
