### What is the ART of Beauty and what was it like 2000 years ago?

In this day and age women (and men by default) have embarked on 'a wild-goose chase' - to obtain *the unobtainable* - ****Media Generated Beauty Standards****!

And even though the ****Photoshop Culture**** has penetrated numerous locations around the world, the *ideal beauty* still remains an elusive concept because each culture sees *beauty* subjectively. This notion has been explored by *Esther Honig* in her ****[Before & After](http://www.people.com/article/beaty-standards-photoshop-esther-honig)**** project when she sent her image to about 40 Photoshop artists around the globe, with a simple instruction: “make me beautiful“).

But despite common knowledge that standards of beauty vary around the world and the media-produced *anti-aging beauty* is more often than not "edited" by sophisticated software, our subconsciously driven tendency to strive for the *magazine perfection* results in *hundreds* of dollars spent at ULTA and Sephora where *fishy smelling face plasmas* and *algae-based anti-aging moisturizers* cost a pretty penny.

Primers and concealers, bronzers and highlighters, foundations and etc etc etc. Their price tags vary from Walgreens to Cos Bar in Manhattan.

The bottom line - *we are obsessed with looks!* The struggle is real.

...But what happened in the long-gone past? And HOW did ****ancient women**** perceive themselves through the lens of the *society-imposed standards*?

Well, life is cyclical and we can *firmly imagine* that human behaviors have always been similar in essence. Let's hypothesize that approximately 2000 years ago ****ancient Roman women**** were just as affected by *ideal* beauty standards as we are now.

Ok, maybe *their version of Megan Fox* descended from Olympus carrying bow and arrows. Also, *beauty* was associated with holiness because let's be *real* - "beautiful" people must have been blessed by Gods! There is really no other logical explanation for *looking good* - LOL!!!

So, did the ancients obsess over their looks? Yes!
Ancient divas regarded cosmetics as the integral part of their daily lives! Some men did too (and maybe we will explore this topic later)...

Prices for ancient cosmetics ranged from low to high. Wealthy Roman women emphasized their ****social status**** with ****expensive beauty items****. Cheap cosmetics often had unpleasant odors and were utilized by ancient prostitutes who often unskillfully overused them on their appearances.

Makeup is and equally was an artistic form, often intricate and meticulous. Therefore, the *quality* process of applying ancient makeup was an elaborate endeavor and required a trained beauty specialist (a slave referred to as ****cosmeta****).

Ancient Roman women enjoyed a wide range of beauty products but their quality lacked durability - ****cremes quickly "melted away"**** and had to be reapplied as often as every couple of hours.   

In Book III of ****“Ars Amatoria”**** (****“The Art of Love”**** in English) ****Publius Ovidius Naso****, a Roman poet commonly known as Ovid, sheds light on various beauty techniques implemented by Roman women 2000 years ago.

{% blockquote Ovid, Ars Amatoria %}
Don't ****those ointments smell****?
Even if they are sent from Athens,
they are ****oils extracted from
the unwashed fleece of a sheep****.
{% endblockquote %}

The ****facial grease**** extracted from the ****unwashed fleece****?! What in the world?!
Wait, but it actually was and still is an effective *beauty product*... ****Lanolin**** is the actual term referred to the ****wool grease**** (or ****wool fat****) and used extensively in products designed for the protection, treatment and beautification of human skin.

Btw, there is a whole ****[article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanolin)**** devoted to the significance of Lanolin (from the Latin words ****lana**** for 'wool' and ****oleum**** for 'oil') both in the ancient and modern high-end beauty industries.

As Ovid continues, we learn more about common "beauty recipes" favored by Ancient Roman women -

{% blockquote Ovid,Ars Amatoria %}
Don't apply preparations of
****deer marrow**** openly...
{% endblockquote %}

OMG ... Let's hope they didn't! But as wacky as it sounds, ****deer's marrow**** was a common ingredient in ancient cosmetics and ointments.

Another famous writer from the times of Antiquity - **** the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder**** - in his book ****Natural History**** advocates the usage of poisonous and disgusting ingredients in facial remedies.

For example, the following preparation was intended to heal facial blemishes : ****veal suet**** (suet is often referred to the hard fat found around the loins and kidneys), ****deer's marrow****, and ****whitehorn leaves****.

Ovid, on the other hand, mainly promoted the usage of herbal facial remedies. He even wrote a poem of 100 verses dedicated entirely to facial treatments - ****Medicamina Faciei Femineae**** (Cosmetics for the Female Face, also known as *The Art of Beauty*).

One of his suggested concoctions for a ****facial mask**** was *a mixture of barley, vetch, egg, hartshorn, narcissus bulb, gum, Tuscan spelt, and honey*. Ovid promises that any woman who uses this recipe on her face ****will shine smoother than her own mirror.****

To give the guy a credit - the majority of the ingredients he prescribes - are, in fact, effective skin treatments.
Oatmeal, wheat germ and egg white are still used in the manufacture of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals today.

Yep, Ovid did his research... Did he experiment on himself? ... Who knows ... But it's worth suggesting that maybe the poet's *obsession* with *youth and beauty* (while the first emperor Augustus was trying to revive *good ol' conservative values*) was the real reason for his eventual exile from Rome.

Anyway Ovid's wisdom keeps on giving - he cautions women to perform their ****beauty preparations**** in a ****private setting****.

{% blockquote Ovid,Ars Amatoria%}
Why should I know the source of the brightness in your looks?
Close your bedroom door! Why betray unfinished work?
...Don’t let your lover find cosmetic bottles
on your dressing table: art delights in its hidden face.
{% endblockquote %}

Hold up! Doesn't this bold and somewhat machoistic attitude go hand in hand with our modern notion of ****a little bag w/ just a couple of things in it...****
*-Yeah, it takes me only 5 minutes to get ready...
 -Really? Ok...*

{% blockquote Ovid,Ars Amatoria%}
...and I don't approve of openly cleaning your teeth:
it makes for beauty, but it's not beautiful to watch:
many things that please when
done, are ugly in the doing...
{% endblockquote %}

We must agree - Ovid's comments are offensive and outrageous! Nevertheless, they provide a valuable glimpse into the ancient beauty standards and societal norms from 2000 years ago. And, frankly, they still exude relevance today - no dodging that in the 21st century *some of us* (or most of us) could relate to this *ancient wisdom* - ****"BEAUTY: *n., perfection in the eye of the beholder - manual labor behind the scenes*"****
