### What was it like - finding a date in Ancient Rome?

*I need a date…
 Time-pressed? Ok, no problem!*
 
It is the 21 century and finding a date is easy! Things are moving fast - virtual reality  searches aggregate/compare gazillions of profiles of some bottomless database, and in seconds give you endless pages of “hand-picked” search results. You look at the proposed “menu items”, slide left, slide right, and Bam! You have a “perfect match” ... and potentially a free dinner at a vegan steakhouse with cool lighting and a provocative decor … Mission accomplished.

Approximately 2000 years ago things for men (and women - less important but still) were happening at a slower pace. Dating was an elaborate endeavor (and not only among the patrician class) - a sophisticated ritual of official introductions, long courtships, subtle hints and ambiguous promises.

Finding a date seemed to be a challenge on its own. So much so that a Roman poet Publius Ovidius Naso, commonly known as Ovid, felt compelled to write “Ars Amatoria” (“The Art of Love” in English). It is a detailed three-book  “manual” on the mysteries of dating and courtship. The Book I teaches men how to find a girlfriend. The Book II gives practical advice on how to keep the “chosen one”. And the Book III gives parallels instructions to women on how “to increase the craft of womankind”.
